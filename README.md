How to cheat in high school Computer Engineering packet tracer assignments (packet tracer v6)

After compiling the program, disguise it as Chrome. Then, running it without holding ctrl will just open chrome (as though it's a shortcut). Running it while holding ctrl doesn't seem to do anything, but it injects code into running packet tracer instances that adds cheat commands to disable restrictions and auto-complete tasks.

I made this as a sophomore in high school, and looking back at that I'm kind of amazed. I also made a version that required getting a key to decrypt PacketTracer offsets from a server at home that would permanently break if run outside of regular class time, which is what I actually used in my Computer Engineering class, but I can't seem to find it now. Either way, I guess this is how to cheat in a high school class with the program in plain sight on the desktop.
